## Project: Administrative Management System - SEPLAG 001/2026
## Role: Senior Computer Engineer - Technical Assessment 

Project Overview
This repository contains the technical implementation for the SEPLAG Public Examination (001/2026) for the position of Senior Computer Engineer. The project serves as a practical demonstration of advanced architectural patterns, focusing on scalability, maintainability, and high-performance cloud-native standards using Java Quarkus.

The solution implements a robust backend service designed to handle public administration workloads, leveraging the Supersonic Subatomic Java capabilities to ensure low memory footprint and fast boot times, essential for modern containerized environments (Kubernetes/OpenShift).

Technical Stack & Architectural Decisions
Framework: Quarkus (Jakarta EE / MicroProfile)

Persistence: Hibernate ORM with Panache (Repository Pattern) for streamlined data access.

Database: PostgreSQL with Flyway for automated schema versioning and migrations—ensuring database consistency across environments.

Validation: Hibernate Validator for robust server-side data integrity.

Communication: REST (Quarkus REST) with Jackson for optimized JSON serialization.

Observability: Integrated JSON Logging for seamless ELK/Splunk integration.

Performance: Configured for Native Executable compilation via GraalVM, optimizing resources for serverless or microservices deployment.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at <http://localhost:8080/q/dev/>.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
./mvnw package
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.jar.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/mario-ramos-rossatti-junior-567868-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult <https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling>.
